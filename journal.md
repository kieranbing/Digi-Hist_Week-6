## Subject search and data extraction
I have had a much harder time with this than I thought I would. It took me much longer than I thought it would to find good data that I could analyse. Once I found that data I realised that extracting what I wanted from it was also much more time consuming than I had anticipated. The source I had chosen, Orwell’s war diaries, was in the form of a WordPress site. This caused issues for me as downloading it’s pages using wget had unexpected results. It ended up downloading the whole page’s HTML. This would mean I would need to comb through 35 large HTML documents in order to extract the data I need. I could write a python script to use REGEX and extract the text between certain HTML tags. However, I didn’t believe I would have time for that. I want to spend most of my time on analysis and presentation, so I didn’t have as much time to spend on data extraction as I was doing. 

In the end I decided that although I think the best solution would be to make a python script to parse the HTML files into the data I need, I don’t know python well enough to do that in the scope of this assignment. So I am going to copy the entries I need and modfy them manually. This means I need to reduce the scope of my analysis, but this is necessary with my current time restraints. 

I turned Orwell’s second war diary into an excel worksheet. It took a lot of time, but I think it was worth it. Now I can both export it to CSV, or use excel to analyse it. It still needs to be refined a bit, there are ‘[1]’ reference markers that I don’t want affecting my analysis. Those should be easy enough to remove with REGEX. 

I removed all of the markers, but wasn’t able to re-import that version of the data back into excel without removing all the new lines. It’s a shame, but it reinforces the lesson I’m learning this week, sometimes it’s the small parts of the project that take the most time and effort. 
## Analysis 
I found this part of the process to be both satisfying and frustrating so far. It’s satisfying looking at my data, thinking of a question, then trying to find an answer to that question. What is frustrating is when the software fights me. Sometimes I find that there is no easy way (that I know of) to do something that I think should be simple. Or there is a way to do it, but a formatting problem or something like that gets in the way. I had to do a lot more manual analysis in excel than I though I would. Still, I found it all rather enjoyable, I just wish I had more time to play around with the data and come to meaningful conclusions. 

I think I did a good job with my excel analysis. If I had more time I know I could add more to it and answer more questions. With the time I had though I think I at least answered one question. It’s also all very nicely organized and I think there is lots of ways to make the data work for me even better. There is lots of potential in analysis like this, I just don’t have any more time in the scope of this last week to capitalise on it. 
## Presentation and Conclusion
I decided to present my data in a combined graph, with the wordcount as a bar graph and the number of entries as a line graph. I think it really highlights the comparison I wanted to make, and the difference between how much Orwell wrote and how often.
