				<p>It [1] has flopped after all. I don’t regard this as final, however. Listened-in to Cripp’s speech coming from Delhi, which we were re-broadcasting for England etc. These transmissions which we occasionally listen-in to from Delhi are our only clue as to how our own broadcasts sound in India. Always very bad quality and a great deal of background noise which it is impossible to take out in recordings. [<em>The speech good in the earlier part and plain-speaking enough to cause, I should think, a lot of offence. In the later part it rather moved off into the breezy uplands vein.</em>] It is a curious fact that in the more exalted passages in his speeches Cripps seems to have caught certain inflexions of voice from Churchill. This may point to the fact – which would explain his having undertaken this mission when only having such bad terms to offer – that he is at present much under Churchill’s personal influence. </p>

				<p>British naval losses in the last 3 or 4 days: 2 cruisers and an aircraft carrier sunk, 1 destroyer wrecked. [1] Axis losses: 1 cruiser sunk.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru">Nehru’s</a> speech today: “Who dies if India live?” How impressed the pinks will be – and how they would snigger at “Who dies if England live?” [2]</p>
<p><em>[1] On 5 April, the heavy cruisers Dorsetshire and Cornwall, the destroyer Tenedos, and the armed merchant-ship Hector were sunk by Japanese aircraft operating from carriers in the Indian Ocean. On 9 April (the day 64,000 Filipinos and 12,000 Americans surrendered at Bataan) the aircraft carrier Hermes and the destroyer Vampire were among a further group of ships sunk by the Japanese in the Indian Ocean, including 135,000 tons of merchant and troop ships.  </em></p>
<p><em>[2] ‘Who dies if England live?’ comes from Kipling’s <a href="http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_forallwehave.htm">‘For All We Have and Are’</a> (1914) and was quoted by Orwell in <a href="http://orwell.ru/library/articles/notes/english/e_notew">‘Notes on the Way’</a>, 30 March and 6 April 1940 (CW, XII, p. 126); it also has the line, ‘The Hun is at the gate!’ Although ‘Hun’ had been used derogatively for a German in the nineteenth century, its twentieth-century usage was introduced by Kaiser Wilhelm II in a widely reported speech when addressing his troops on 27 July 1900 before their departure for China.  </em></p>

				<p>[<em>Yesterday had a look at the bit of the by-pass road which is being built between Uxbridge and Denham. Amazed at the enormous scale of the undertaking. West of Uxbridge is the valley of the Colne, and over this the road runs on a viaduct of brick and concrete pillars, the viaduct being I suppose ¼ mile long. After that it runs on a raised embankment. Each of these pillars is 20 feet high or thereabouts, about 15 by 10 feet thick, and there are two of them every fifteen yards or so. I should say each pillar would use 40,000 bricks, exclusive of foundations, and exclusive of the concrete running above, which must use up tons of steel and concrete for every yard of road. Stupendous quantities of steel (for reinforcing) lying about, also huge slabs of granite. Building this viaduct alone must be a job comparable, in the amount of labour it uses up, to building a good-sized warship. And the by-pass is very unlikely to be of any use till after the war, even if finished by that time. Meanwhile there is a labour shortage everywhere. Apparently the people who sell bricks are all-powerful. (Cf. the useless surface-shelters, which even when they were being put up were being put up were pronounced to be useless by everyone who knew anything about building, and the unnecessary repairs to uninhabited private houses which are going on all over London). Evidently when a scandal passes a certain magnitude it becomes invisible.</em>]</p>
<p>Saw in Denham someone driving a dog-cart, in quite good trim. <em> </em></p>

				<p>Cripp’s decision to stay an extra week in India is taken as a good omen. Otherwise not much to be hopeful about. Gandhi is deliberately making trouble, [<em>sending telegrams of condolence to Bose’s </em>[1] <em>family on the report of his death, then telegrams of congratulations when it turned out that the report was untrue. Also urging Indians not to adopt the scorched earth policy if India is invaded</em>]. Impossible to be quite sure what his game is. Those who are anti-Gandhi allege that he has the worst kind of (Indian) capitalist interests behind him, and it is a fact that he usually seems to be staying at the mansion of some kind of millionaire [<em>or other. This is not necessarily incompatible with his alleged saintliness. His pacifism may be genuine, however. In the bad period of 1940 he also urged non-resistance in England, should England be invaded</em>].  I do not know whether Gandhi or Buchman [2] is the nearest equivalent to Rasputin in our time.</p>
<p>Anand [3] says the morale among the exile Indians here is very low. They are still inclined to think that Japan has no evil designs on India and are all talking of a spate peace with Japan. So much for their declarations of loyalty towards Russia and China. I said to A[nand] that the basic fact about nearly all Indian intellectuals is that they don’t expect independence, can’t imagine it and at heart don’t want it. They want to be permanently in opposition, suffering a painless martyrdom, and are foolish enough to imagine that they could play the same schoolboy games with Japan or Germany that they can with Britain. Somewhat to my surprise he agreed. He says that “opposition mentality” is general among them, especially among the Communists, and that Krishna Menon [4] is “longing for the moment when negations will break down”. At the same moment as they are coolly talking of betraying China be making a separate peace, they are shouting that the Chinese troops in Burma are not getting proper air support. I remarked that this was childish. A: “You cannot overestimate their childishness, George. It is fathomless”. [<em>The question is how far the Indians here reflect the viewpoint of the intellectuals in India. They are further from the danger and have probably, like the rest of us, been infected by the peaceful atmosphere of the last 10 months, but on the other hand nearly all who remain here long become tinged with a western Socialist outlook, so that the Indian intellectuals proper are probably far worse. A. himself has not got these vices. He is genuinely anti-Fascist, and has done violence to his feelings, and probably to his reputation, by backing Britain up because he recognizes that Britain is objectively on the anti-Fascist side.</em>]</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose">Subhas Chandra Bose</a> (1897-1945) was an Indian nationalist leader and left-wing member of the Indian National Congress. Fiercely anti-British, he organised an Indian National Army to support the Japanese. This he led, unsuccessfully, against the British. He believed that when the INA faced Indian troops led by the British, the latter would not fight but be converted. ‘Instead, the revolutionary had reverted to his comfortable mercenary status. INA soldiers took to looting from local tribes’ (Mihir Bose, The Lost Hero [1982], p. 236). His followers long believed him to be still alive (despite two Indian government inquiries), but it seems certain he died following a plane crash on 19 August 1945 (The Lost Hero, pp. 251-52). Documents released by the War Office in November 1993 show that a substantial number of Indian prisoners of war defected to the Italians, the first 3,000 arriving in Italy in August 1942. A British Intelligence report stated, ‘We have by our policy towards India, bred up a new class of officer who may be loyal to India, and perhaps to Congress, but is not necessarily loyal to us’ (Daily Telegraph, 5 December 1993).</em></p>
<p><em>[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Buchman">Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a> (1878-1961), evangelist and propagandist, founded, in 1921, the Moral Re-Armament movement, also known, from its place of foundation, as the Oxford Group Movement, and sometimes as Buchmanism.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulk_Raj_Anand">Mulk Raj Anand</a> (1905-2004), novelist, story-writer, essayist, and critic. He was born in India, fought in the Spanish Civil War (though he did not meet Orwell there), and taught literature and philosophy to London County Council adult education classes. He wrote scripts for the BBC, 1939-45. After the war he returned to India and lectured at various universities and was made Professor of Fine Arts, University of Punjab, in 1963. Orwell reviewed his The Sword and the Sickle in Horizon, July 1942 (CW, XIII, pp. 379-81). In a letter of 29 September 1983 Anand wrote this of Orwell: ‘In his life his voice was restrained. He talked in furtive whispers. Often he dismissed the ugly realities with cynical good humour. And I seldom saw him show anger in his face, though the two deep lines on his cheeks and the furrowed brow signified permanent despair. He smiled at tea time and he was a good companion in a pub. But he delivered his shafts in a very mellow voice, something particularly English deriving from the Cockney sense of humour’. See Abha Sharma Rodrigues, ‘George Orwell, the BBC, and India: A Critical Study’ (Edinburgh University, PhD, 1994).  </em></p>
<p><em>[4] V.K. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Menon">Krishna Menon</a> (1897-1974), Indian statesman, lawyer, author, and journalist, was then living in England. He was active in British left-wing politics and was spokesman of the Indian Congress Party in England in the struggle for independence. In 1947, when India had become independent, he was High Commissioner for India and he represented India at the United Nations, 1952-61. On 31 January 1943, he was one of six speakers at the ‘India Demonstration’ at the London Coliseum (Tribune, 29 January 1943, p. 20). </em></p>

				<p>Greatly depressed by the apparent failure of the Cripps mission.  Most of the Indians seem down in the mouth about it too. Even the ones who hate England want a solution, I think. [<em>I believe, however, that in spite of the “take it or leave it” with which our government started off, the terms will actually be modified, perhaps in response to pressure at this end.</em>] Some think the Russians are behind the Cripps plan and that this accounts for Cripps’s confidence in putting forward something so apparently uninviting. Since they are not in the war against Japan the Russians cannot have any official attitude about the Indian affair, but they may serve out a directive to their followers, for whom it will get round to other pro-Russians. No sign yet from the English Communist party, whose behaviour might give a clue to the Russian attitude. It is on this kind of guesswork that we have to frame our propaganda, no clear or useful directive ever being handed out from above.</p>
<p>Connolly wanted yesterday to quote a passage from <em>Homage to Catalonia </em>in his broadcast. I opened the book and came on these sentences:</p>
<p>“One of the most horrible features of war is that all the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting&#8230;It is the same in all wars; the soldiers do the fighting, the journalists do the shouting, and no true patriot ever gets near a front line trench, except on the briefest of propaganda tours. Sometimes it is a comfort to me to think that the aeroplane is altering the conditions of war. Perhaps when the next great war comes we may see that sight unprecedented in all history, a jingo with a bullet-hole in him.” [1]</p>
<p>Here I am in the BC, less than 5 years after writing that. I suppose sooner or later we all write our own epitaphs.</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/homage-to-catalonia/" />Homage to Catalonia</a>, CW, VI, Appendix I, pp. 208 and 209. </em></p>

				<p>News of the terms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps">Cripps</a> took to India supposed to be bursting tomorrow. Meanwhile only rumours, all plausible but completely incompatible with one another. The best-supported  &#8211; that India is to be offered a treaty similar to the Egyptian one. K.S.S [1] who is our fairly embittered enemy, considers this would be accepted if Indians were given the Ministries of Defence, Finance and Internal Affairs. All the Indians here, after a week or two of gloom, much more optimistic, seeming to have smelt out somehow (perhaps by studying long faces in the India Office) that the terms are not so bad after all</p>
<p>[<em>Terrific debate in the House over the affaire <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>.</span></em> [2]<em> A. Bevan </em>[3]<em> reading numerous extracts from Morrison’s </em>[4] <em>own articles in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">D.M.</span>, written since war started, to the amusement of Conservatives who are anti-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">D.M </span>but can never resist the spectacle of two Socialists slamming one another. Cassandra </em>[5] <em>announces he is resigning to join the army. Prophecy he will be back in journalism within 3 months. But where shall we all be within 3 months any way?</em>] <em> </em></p>
<p>Government candidate defeated (very small majority) in the Grantham by-election. The first time since the war started that this has happened, I think.</p>
<p>Surprise call-out of our Company of Home Guard a week or two back. IT took 4 ½ hours to assemble the Company and dish out ammunition, and would have taken them another hour to get them into their battle positions. This mainly due to the bottleneck caused by refusing to distribute ammunition but making each man come to HQ to be issued with it there. Sent a memo on this to Dr Tom Jones, [6] who has forwarded it direct to Sir Jas. Grigg. [7] In my own unit I could not get such a memo even as far as the Company Commander – or at least, could not get it attended to.</p>
<p>Crocuses now full out. One seems to catch glimpses of them dimly through a haze of war news.</p>
<p>[<em>Abusive letter from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, who addresses me as “You shit”, among other things. </em>[8]</p>
<p><em>The Vatican is exchanging diplomatic representatives with Tokio. The Vatican now has diplomatic relations with all the Axis powers and – I think – with none of the Allies. A bad sign and yet in a sense a good one, in that this last step means that they have now definitely decided that the Axis and not we stand for the more reactionary policy.</em>]</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-krishnarao-shelvankar-1281410.html">Dr. Krishna S. Shelvankar</a> (1906-1996), Indian writer and journalist. He was in England during the war as a correspondent for Indian newspapers. His book, The Problem of India (Pengiun Special, 1940), was banned in India. Orwell’s superior at the BBC, Z. A. Bokhari, wrote to the Eastern Service Director to say he was strongly opposed to Shelvankar being allowed to broadcast: ‘Call me a die-hard if you like, but in my opinion the time has not come for us to make such advances towards the truculent damsel – “Miss Nationalsim”’ (CW, XIII, p. 242). Despite Orwell’s reference to Shelvankar as ‘our fairly embittered enemy’, he did broadcast to India under Orwell’s aegis. When Pakistan became independent, Bokhari was appointed Director-General of Pakistan Radio.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] The Daily Mirror, a popular leftist daily newspaper, had been called to order by Churchill for taking what he called a defeatist line, that is, critical of the government’s handling of the war. After the debate in the House of Commons the affair fizzled out.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurin_Bevan">Aneurin (Nye) Bevan</a> (see Events, 29.8.39, n. 11), Labour M.P., had been, for most of 1939, in conflict with his party and he was expelled for supporting Sir Stafford’s Cripp’s Popular Front campaign though his integrity was never in doubt. He edited Tribune, 1942-45 (a remarkable achievement for someone who could barely read when he left school at the age of thirteen), and gave Orwell support even when he disagreed with him. His great achievement was the creation of the National Health Service out of a variety of earlier proposals. His In Place of Fear (1952) sets out his philosophy.</em></p>
<p><em> [4] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a> (1888-1965; Baron Morrison of Lambeth), Labour MP from 1923, Leader of the London Country Council, 1933-40; Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, 1940-45. He was Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister, in Clement Attlee’s two administrations, 1945-51. In the debate to which Orwell refers, his subversive writings from World War I, when he was a conscientious objector, were also quoted (see Hugh Cudlipp, Publish and be Damned, pp. 195-6).</em></p>
<p><em>[5] This was the pseudonym of William Connor (1900-1967; Kt., 1966) a well-known radical journalist who wrote this personal column in the Daily Mirror. His English at War (April 1941) was the most popular of the Searchlight Books edited by T.R. Fyvel and Orwell; it was reprinted three times.</em></p>
<p><em>[6] Dr Tom Jones 91870-1955; CH), Cabinet Secretary to Lloyd George. In 1939 he was instrumental in the establishment of CEMA – the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts – which later became the Arts Council of Great Britain.</em></p>
<p><em>[7] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Grigg">Sir James Grigg</a> (1890 – 1964; KCB), Permanent Under-Secretary for War, 1939&#8211;42, and Secretary of State for War, 1942-45. He had served as Finance Member on the Viceroy of India’s Council and when Churchill set up the India Committee on 25 February 1942 he was selected to advise on Indian affairs. Churchill wanted him to accept a peerage but he declined. His wife, Lady Grigg, who was involved in the radio series, ‘Women Generally Speaking’, for the BBC’s Eastern Service, was a thorn in Orwell’s flesh.</em></p>
<p><em>[8] This stemmed initially from Orwell’s article ‘Wells, Hitler and the World State,’ Horizon, August 1941 (CW, XII, pp. 536-41) and was further stimulated by his broadcast talk “The Re-discovery of Europe,’ about which Wells wrote to The Listener. Inez Holden was present at a ‘God-awful row’ between Wells and Orwell arising from the Horizon article. Orwell thought Well’s belief that the Germans might be defeated quite soon was a disservice to the general public; Wells accused Orwell of being defeatist, though he withdrew that. The outburst passed over reasonably amicably, but was revived when Orwell’s broadcast was printed in The Listener, leading to the abusive letter mentioned here. Holden wrote to Ian Angus, 21 May 1967, that Orwell very much regretted the Horizon article and was sorry he had upset Wells, whom he had always greatly admired. See also Crick, pp. 427-31. </em></p>

				<p>Empson tells me that there is a strict ban by the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign Office</a> on any suggestion that Japan is going to attack the USSR. So this subject is being studiously avoided in the Far Eastern broadcasts while being pushed all the time in the India broadcasts. They haven’t yet got onto the fact that we are saying this, we haven’t been warned and don’t officially know about the ban, and are making the best of our opportunity while it lasts. The same chaos everywhere on the propaganda front. [<em>E.g. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Horizon </span>was nearly stopped from getting its extra paper to print copies for export on the strength of my article on <a href="http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/rudyard-kipling-1936/">Kipling</a> (all well at the last moment because Harold Nicholson </em>[1] <em>and Duff Cooper [2] intervened), at the same time as the BBC asked me to write a “feature” based on the article.</em>]</p>
<p>German  propaganda is inconsistent in quite a different way – ie, deliberately so, with an utter unscrupulousness in offering everything to everybody, freedom to India and a colonial empire to Spain, emancipation to the Kaffirs and stricter race laws to the Boers, etc., etc. All quite sound from a propaganda point of view in my opinion, seeing how politically ignorant the majority of people are, how uninterested in anything outside their immediate affair, and how little impressed by inconsistency. A few weeks back the NBBS [3] was actually attacking the Workers’ Challenge [<em>Station</em>], [4] warning people not to listen to it as it was “financed from Moscow.”</p>
<p>The Communists in Mexico are again chasing Victor Serge [5] and other Trotskyist refugees who got there from France, urging their expulsion, etc., etc. Just the same tactics as in Spain. Horrible depressed to see these ancient intrigues coming up again, not so much because they are morally disgusting as from the reflection; for 20 years the Comintern has used these methods and the Comintern has always and everywhere been defeated by the Fascists; therefore we, being tied to them in a species of alliance, shall be defeated with them.</p>
<p>Suspicion that Russia intends making a separate peace now seems widespread. Of the two, it would be easier for Russia to surrender the Ukraine, both on geographical and psychological grounds, but they obviously couldn’t give up the Caucasus oilfields without a fight. One possible development is a secret agreement between Hitler and Stalin, Hitler to keep what Russian territory he has overrun, or parts of it, but thereafter to make no further attacks but to direct his offensive southward towards the oilfields of Irak and Iran, Russia and Germany keeping up a sham war meanwhile. It appears to me that a separate peace is distinctly likelier if we do make a continental invasion this year, because if we succeed in embarrassing the Germans and drawing off a large part of their armies Russia is immediately in a much better position both to win back the occupied territories, and to bargain. I nevertheless think we ought to invade Europe if the shipping will run to it. The one thing that might stop this kind of filthy double crossing is a firm alliance between ourselves and the USSR, with war aims declared in detail. Impossible while this government rules us, and probably also while Stain remains in power: [<em>at least only possible if we could get a different kind of government and then find some way of speaking over Stalin’s head to the Russian people</em>].</p>
<p>The same feeling as one had during the Battle of France – that there is no news. This arises principally from endless newspaper-reading. [<em>In connection with my newsletters I now read four or five morning newspapers ever day and several editions of the evening ones, besides the daily monitoring report.</em>] The amount of new matter in each piece of print one reads is so small that one gets a general impression that nothing is happening. Besides, when things are going badly one can foresee everything. The only event that has surprise me for weeks past was Cripp’s mission to India.</p>
<p><em>[1] For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> (1886-1968; Kt. 1953) critic, biographer, and M.P., see events, 30.8.39, n. 1. Among his biographies were those of Tennyson, Byron, Swinburne, Lord Curzon, King George V, and Sainte-Beuve.</em></p>
<p><em>[2]For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_Cooper">Alfred Duff Cooper</a> (1890-1954; Viscount Norwich, 1952), diplomat, biographer of Talleyrand and Earl Haig; see War-time Diary, 29.5.40 n. 4. He had served briefly as War Cabinet representative in Singapore, and responsibility was partly, if hardly fairly, laid at his door for its fall. He was British representative with the French Committee of National Liberation in North Africa (headed by General de Gaulle), and for three years from September 1944 was British Ambassador in Paris. His autobiography is Old Men Forget (1953).</em></p>
<p><em>[3] New British Broadcasting Station broadcast propaganda in English from Germany. For Orwell’s description of its policy, see his ‘London Letter,’ 1 January 1942, CW, XIII, pp. 110-111. W.J. West devotes a chapter of his Truth Betrayed (1987) to the new British Broadcasting Station. He also discusses two other German stations which broadcast to Britain, the Workers Challenge Station and the Christian Peace Movement [station]; he prints three of their broadcasts in an Appendix.</em></p>
<p><em>[4] this was another station broadcasting propaganda in English from Germany.</em></p>
<p><em>[5] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Serge">Victor Serge</a> (Kilbt’chiche; 1890-1947), author and journalist, born in Brussels of exiled Russian intellectuals, was French by adoption. He was associated with the anarchist movement in Paris. After the Russian Revolution, he transferred his activities to Moscow, Leningrad, and Berlin (where he ran a newspaper, the Communist International). His close association with Trotsky led to his deportation to Siberia in 1933. After his release, he was Paris correspondent for the POUM during the Spanish civil war. In 1941 he settled in Mexico, where he died, impoverished. Among his many books are From Lenin to Stalin (1937; translated from French); Vie et mort de Trotsky (Paris, 1951) and Memoires d’un révolutionnaire 1901-1941 (Paris, 1951; English translation, Memoirs of a Revolutionary, 1963). He wrote an introduction to Revolution et contre-revolution en Espagne by Joaquin Maurin (1896-1973) co-founder of the POUM (1937). </em></p>
