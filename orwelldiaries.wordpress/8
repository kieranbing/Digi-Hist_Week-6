				<p>According to W. [1] a real Anglo-Russian alliance is to be signed up and the Russian delegates are already in London. I don’t believe this.</p>
<p>The Turkish radio (for some time past I think this has been one of the most reliable sources of information) alleges that both Germans and Russians are preparing to use poison gas in the forthcoming battle.</p>
<p>[<em>Great naval battle in progress in the Coral Sea. </em>[2] <em>Sinkings claimed by both sides so vast that one does not know what to believe. But from the willingness of the Japanese radio to talk about the battle (they have already named it the Battle of the Coral Sea) the presumption is that they count on making their objective.</em></p>
<p><em>My guess as to the identity of ‘Thomas Rainsborough’; Tom Wintringham. (Right!) </em></p>
<p><em>(30.5.42. Wintringham denies the authorship of these articles, but I still think he wrote them.)</em> [3] ]</p>
<p><em>[1] Fredric Warburg (1898-1980), managing director of Secker &amp; Warburg and Orwell’s publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] The Battle of the Coral Sea, 4-8 May, was the first naval engagement fought entirely by aircraft, the ships involved never coming into each other’s sight. The Americans lost the aircraft carrier Lexington, a tanker, a destroyer, 74 planes, and 543 men; the Japanese lost the light carrier Shoho, a destroyer, over 80 planes and more than 1,000 men. (Liddell Hart, History of the Second World War, pp. 361-63).</em></p>
<p><em>[3] Entry in parentheses, dated 30 May, was added by Orwell to the manuscript version only. </em></p>

				<p>People do not seem pleased about Madagascar [1] as they did about Syria, [2] perhaps not grasping equally well its strategical significance, but more, I think, for want of a suitable propaganda buildup beforehand. [<em>In the case of Syria the obviousness of the danger, the continual stories about German infiltration, and the long uncertainty as to whether the Government would act, gave people the impression that it was public opinion which had forced the decision. For all I know it may ever have done so, to some extent. No similar preparation in this case.</em>] As soon as it became clear that Singapore was in danger I pointed out that we might have to seize Madagascar and had better begin the buildup in our Indian newsletters. I was somewhat choked off even then, and some weeks back a directive came, I suppose from the Foreign Office, that Madagascar was not to be mentioned. Reason given (after the British troops had landed) “So as not to give the show away”. Result, the seizure of Madagascar can be represented all over Asia as a piece of imperialist grabbing.</p>
<p>Saw two women driving in an old-fashioned governess cart today. A week or two back saw two men in a carriage and pair, and one of the men actually wearing a grey bowler hat.</p>
<p>[<em>Much speculation as to the authorship of articles in the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tribune</span>, violently attacking Churchill and signed “Thomas Rainsborough”. </em>[3] <em>Considered by some to be Frank Owen, </em>[4]<em> which I do not believe.</em>]</p>
<p><em>[1] Allied forces landed at Diego-Suarez, Madagascar, on 5 May and by September had taken over the island, strategically important in the light of naval losses in the Indian Ocean. It had supported the Vichy government under Pétain.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] It was rumoured that the Germans would move east from Crete in June 1941. Allied forces therefore invaded Syria, wresting it from Vichy French troops.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Rainsborough">Thomas Rainsborough</a>, or Rainborow, was a republican who fought for the Commonwealth in the Civil War. He commanded the warship Swallow in 1643 and two years later a regiment in the New Model Army. In 1646 he became an M.P. and led republicans in Parliament but was eventually reconciled with Cromwell. He was fatally wounded in battle in 1648. The name was adopted in Tribune to exemplify extreme radical, Leveller-type views. The pseudonym was being used by Frank Owen.  </em></p>
<p><em>[4] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Owen_(politician)">Frank Owen</a> (1905-1979; OBE, military), journalist, author, and broadcaster, was a Liberal M.P., 1929-31; edited the Daily Express, 1931-37 and the Evening Standard, 1938-41 (both right-wing Beaverbrook newspapers). With Michael Foot (acting editor, Evening Standard, 1942; later, Deputy Leader and Leader of the labour Party, 1976-83) and Peter Howard, he wrote Guilty Men (Gollancz 1940), under the pseudonym Cato, which attacked Chamberlain, Halifax, and other Conservative leaders for appeasing Hitler. In Beaverbrook: A Study in Power and Frustration (1956), Tom Driberg writes of Owen, ‘who had lately been called up but was writing in Tribune, under the pseudonym Thomas Rainsborough, articles severely critical of Churchill and his war strategy’ (p. 287). He served in the Royal Armoured Corps and South East Asia Command, 1942-46, and was promoted from trooper to lieutenant colonel by Lord Louis Mountbatten with instructions to produce a daily paper for the command from 1943 despite the strenuous opposition of Sir James Grigg. He reprinted in SEAC seven of the occasional pieces Orwell wrote for the Evening Standard, 1945-46. He edited the Daily Mail, 1947-50, and wrote, among other books, The Three Dictators (1940) and The Fall of Singapore (1960). </em></p>

				<p>[<em>Much speculation about the meaning of Hitler’s speech yesterday. In general it gives an impression of pessimism. Beaverbrook’s invasion speech is variously interpreted, at its face value, as a pep talk for the Americans, as something to persuade the Russians that we are not leaving them in the lurch, and as the beginning of an attack on Churchill (who may be forced into opposing offensive action). Nowadays, whatever is said or done, one looks instantly for hidden motives and assumes that words mean anything except what they appear to mean.</em>]</p>
<p>From the Italian radio, describing life in London:</p>
<p>“Five shillings were given for one egg yesterday, and one pound sterling for a kilogram of potatoes. Rice has disappeared, even from the Black Market, and peas have become the prerogative of millionaires. There is no sugar on the market, although small quantities are still to be found at prohibitive prices”.</p>
<p>One would say that this is stupid propaganda, because if such conditions really existed England would stop fighting in a few weeks, and when this fails to happen the listener is bound to see that he has been deceived. But in fact there is no such reaction. You can go on and on telling lies, and the most palpable lies at that, and even if they are not actually believed, there is no strong revulsion either.</p>
<p>We are all drowning in filth. When I talk to anyone or read the writings of anyone who has any axe to grind, I feel that intellectual honesty and balanced judgement have simply disappeared from the face of the earth. Everyone’s thought is forensic, everyone is simply putting a “case” with deliberate suppression of his opponent’s point of view, and, what is more, with complete insensitiveness to any sufferings except those of himself and his friends. The Indian nationalist is sunken in self-pity and hatred of Britain and utterly indifferent to the miseries of China, the English pacifist works himself up into frenzies about the concentration camps in the Isle of Man and forgets about those in Germany, etc. etc. One notices this in the case of people one disagrees with, such as Fascists or pacifists but in fact everyone is the same, at least everyone is utterly heartless towards people who are outside the immediate range of his own interests. What is most striking of all is the way sympathy can be turned on and off like a tap according to political expediency. [<em>All the pinks, or most of them, who flung themselves to and fro in their rage about Nazi atrocities before the war, forgot all about these atrocities and obviously lost their sympathy with the Jews etc. as soon as the war began to bore them. Ditto with people who hated Russia like poison up to June 22 1941 and then suddenly forgot about the purges, the G.P.U. etc. the moment Russia came into the war. I am not thinking of lying for political ends, but of actual changes in subjective feeling.</em>] But is there no one who has both firm opinions and a balanced outlook? Actually there are plenty, but they are all powerless. All power is in the hands of paranoiacs.</p>

				<p>U.S. airmen making a forced landing on Russian soil after bombing Tokio have been interned. According to the Japanese wireless the Russians are expediting the movement of Japanese agents across Russia from Sweden (and hence from Germany) to Japan. [<em>If true, this is a new development, this traffic having been stopped at the time when Germany attacked the USSR.</em>]</p>
<p>The mystery of Subhas Chandra Bose’s whereabouts remains impenetrable. [<em>The leading facts are: &#8211; </em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>i.                     </em><em>At the time of his disappearance, the British government declared that he had gone to Berlin.</em></li>
<li><em>ii.                   </em><em>A voice, identified as his, broadcasts on the Free India radio (Germany).</em></li>
<li><em>iii.                  </em><em>The Italian radio has claimed at least once that Bose is in Japanese territory.</em></li>
<li><em>iv.                 </em><em>Indians here seem on the whole to think that he is in Japanese territory. </em></li>
<li><em>v.                   </em><em>Escape into Japanese territory would have been physically easier than escape in the other direction, though the latter would not have been impossible.</em></li>
<li><em>vi.                 </em><em>The Vichy report of his death in a plane accident between Bangkok and Tokio, though almost certainly mistaken, seemed to suggest that Vichy quarters took it for granted that he was in Japanese territory.</em></li>
<li><em>vii.                </em><em>According to engineers it would not be impossible to broadcast his voice scrambled from Tokio to Berlin and there unscramble and rebroadcast it.</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>There are innumerable other considerations and endless rumours.</em>] The two questions hardest to answer are: If Bose is in Japanese territory, why this elaborate effort to make it appear that he is in Berlin, where he is comparatively ineffectual? If Bose is in German territory, how did he get there? Of course it is quite reasonably likely that he got there with Russian connivance. Then the question arises, if the Russians had previously passed Bose through, did they afterwards tip us off when they came into the war on our side? To know the answer to that would give one useful clue to their attitude towards ourselves. Of course one can get no information about questions of that type here. One has to do one’s propaganda in the dark, discreetly sabotaging the policy directives when they seem more than usually silly. [1]</p>
<p>To judge from their wireless, the Germans believe in a forthcoming invasion, either from France or Norway. What a chance to have a go at Spain! As, however, they have fixed a date of it (May 1<sup>st</sup>) they may merely be discussing the possibility of invasion in order to jeer when it does not come off. No sign here of any invasion preparations – no rumours about assembly of troops or boats, re-arrangement of railway schedules etc. The most positive sign is Beaverbrook’s pro-invasion speech in the USA.</p>
<p>[<em>There seems to be no news whatever. It must be months since the papers were so empty.</em>]</p>
<p>Struck by the mediocre physique and poor general appearance of the American soldiers one seems from time to time in the street. The officers usually better than the men, however.</p>
<p><em>[1] Bose escaped from India, with German help, via Afghanistan, in the winter of 1940-41. When he reached Moscow, the Russians ‘were extremely hospitable but determinedly evasive about helping him. In Berlin the Germans were more receptive’ (Mihir Bose, The Lost Hero, p. 162). He was in Germany until 8 February 1943, when he sailed from Kiel in a U-boat (p. 205). </em></p>

				<p>Tokio bombed, or supposed to have been bombed, yesterday. [1] Hitherto this comes only from Japanese and German sources. Nowadays one takes it so much for granted that everyone is lying that a report of this kind is never believed until confirmed by both sides. Even an admission by the enemy that his capital had been bombed might for some reason or other be a lie.</p>
<p>[<em>[Eileen]</em> <em>says that Anand remarked to her yesterday, as though it were a matter of course, that Britain would make a separate peace this year, and seemed surprised when she demurred. Of course Indians have to say this, and have been saying it ever since 1940, because it furnishes them if necessary with an excuse for being anti-war, and also because if they could allow themselves to think any good of Britain whatever their mental framework would be destroyed. Fyvel told me how in 1940, at the time when Chamberlain was still in government, he was at a meeting at which Pritt and various Indians were present. The Indians were remarking in their pseudo-Marxist way “Of course the Churchill-Chamberlain government is about to make a compromise peace”, whereat Pritt told them that Churchill would never make peace and that the only difference (then) existing in Britain was the difference between Churchill and Chamberlain.</em>]</p>
<p>More and more talk about an invasion of Europe – so much so as to make one think something of the kind must be afoot, otherwise the newspapers would not risk causing disappointment by talking so much about it. Amazed by the unrealism of much of this talk. Nearly everyone seems still to think that gratitude is a factor is power politics. Two assumptions which are habitually made throughout the Left press are a. that opening up a second front is the way to stop Russia making a separate peace, and b. that the more fighting we do the more say we shall have in the final peace settlement. Few people seem to reflect that if an invasion of Europe succeeded to the point of drawing the German armies away from Russia, Stalin would have no strong motive for going on fighting [<em>and that a sell-out of this kind would be quite in line with the Russo-German pact and the agreement which the USSR has evidently entered into with Japan</em>]. As to the other assumption, many people talk as though the power to decide policy when a war has been won were a sort of reward for having fought well in it. Of course the people actually able to dominate affairs are those who have the most military power, cf. America at the end of the last war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two steps which could right the situation, a. a clear agreement with the USSR and a joint (and fairly detailed) declaration of war aims, and b. an invasion of Spain, are politically quite impossible under the present government.</p>
<p><em>[1] On 18 April, sixteen B-25 bombers, led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle">Colonel James H. Doolittle</a>, flew from the carrier Hornet and bombed Tokyo. The effect was psychological rather than military. Because the planes had insufficient fuel to make the return flight, they flew on to China. Bad weather forced several crash-landings; one plane landed near Vladivostok and the crew was interned; two landed in Japanese-held territory and some airmen were executed on 15 October 1942. Of the 80 crew members, 71 survived. </em></p>

				<p>No question that Cripp’s speeches etc. have caused a lot of offence, ie. in India. Outside India I doubt whether many people blame the British government for the breakdown. One trouble at the moment is the tactless utterances of Americans who for years have been blahing about “Indian freedom” and British Imperialism, and have suddenly had their eyes opened to the fact that the Indian intelligentsia don’t want independence, ie. responsibility. Nehru is making provocative speeches to the effect that all the English are the same, of whatever political party, and also trying to make trouble between Britain and the USA by alleging that the USA has done all the real fighting. At the same time he reiterates at intervals that he is not pro-Japanese and Congress will defend India to the last. The BBC thereupon picks out these passages from his speeches and broadcasts them without mentioning the anti-British passages, whereat Nehru complains (quite justly) that he has been misrepresented.</p>
<p>[<em>A recent directive tells us that when one of his speeches contains both anti-British and anti-Japanese passages, we had better ignore it altogether. What a mess it all is. But I think on balance the Cripps mission has done good, because without discrediting Cripps in this country (as it so easily might have done) it has clarified the issue. Whatever is said officially, the inference the whole world will draw is that (a) the British ruling class doesn’t intend to abdicate and (b) India doesn’t want independence and therefore won’t get it, whatever the outcome of the war.</em></p>
<p><em>Talking to Wintringham </em>[1] <em>about the possible Russian attitude towards the Cripps negotiations (of course, not being in the war against Japan, they can’t have an official attitude)</em> <em>I said it might make things easier if as many as possible of the military instructors etc. who will later have to sent to India were Russians. One possible outcome is that India will ultimately be taken over by the USSR, and though I have never believed that the Russians would behave better in India than ourselves, they might behave differently, owing to the different economic set-up. Wintringham said that even in Spain some of the Russian delegates tended to treat the Spaniards as “natives”, and would no doubt do likewise in India. It’s very hard not to, seeing that in practice the majority of Indians are inferior to Europeans and one can’t help feeling this and, after a little while, acting accordingly.</em>]<em> </em></p>
<p>American opinion will soon swing back and begin putting all the blame for the Indian situation on the British, as before. It is clear from what American papers one can get hold of that anti-British feeling is in full cry and that all the Isolationists, after a momentary retirement, have re-emerged with the same slogans as before. [<em>Father Coughlin’s paper, </em>[2] <em>however, has just been excluded from the mails.</em>] What always horrifies me about American anti-British sentiment is its appalling ignorance. Ditto presumably with the Anti-American feeling in England.</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wintringham">Thomas Henry (Tom) Wintringham</a>, writer and soldier, had commanded the British Battalion of the International Brigade in the Spanish civil war. He later founded Osterley Park Training Centre for the Home Guard. His books include New Ways of War, Politics of Victory, and People’s War. See War-time Diary, 23. 8. 40, n. 91 and David Fernbach, ‘Tom Wintringham and Socialist Defence Strategy’ History Workshop, 14 (1982), 63-91.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coughlin">Father Charles E. Coughlin</a> (1891-1979), born and educated in Canada, became a Roman Catholic priest and achieved prominence through use of the radio in the United States in the 1930s. As early as 1934, when he founded the National Union for Social Justice, he argued that the United States was being manipulated by Britain into involvement in a new European war; ‘I raise my voice,’ he said, ‘to keep America out of war.’ Orwell refers to his magazine, Social Justice, in which he expressed near-Fascist views. Its circulation through the mail was forbidden in the United States because it contravened the Espionage Act. It ceased publication in 1942, the year Coughlin was silenced by his ecclesiastical superiors. </em></p>
