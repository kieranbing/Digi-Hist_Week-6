					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The thing that strikes one in the BBC – and it is evidently same in various of the other departments – is not so much the moral squalor and the ultimate futility of what we are doing, as the feeling of frustration, the impossibility of getting anything done, even any successful piece of scoundrelism. Our policy is so ill-defined, the disorganisation is so great [<em>there are so many changes of plan</em>] and the fear and hatred of intelligence are so all-pervading, that one cannot plan any sort of wireless campaign whatever. [<em>When one plans some series of talks, with some more or less definite propaganda line behind it, one is first told to go ahead, then choked off on the ground that this or that is “injudicious” or “premature”, then told again to go ahead, then told to water everything down and cut out any plain statements that may have crept in here and there, then told to “modify” the series in some way that removes its original meaning; and then at the last moment the whole thing is suddenly cancelled by some mysterious edict from above and one is told to improvise some different series which one feels no interest in and which in any case has no definite idea behind it.</em>]</p>
<p>One is constantly putting sheer rubbish on the air because of having talks which sounded too intelligent cancelled at the last moment. In addition the organisation is so overstaffed that numbers of people have almost literally nothing to do. But even when one manages to get something fairly good on the air one is weighed down by the knowledge that hardly anybody is listening. Except, I suppose, in Europe the BBC simply inst listened to overseas, a fact known to everyone concerned with overseas broadcasting. [<em>Some listener research has been done in America and it is known that in the whole of the USA about 300,000 people listen to the BBC. In India or Australia the number would not be anywhere near that.</em>] It has come out recently that (two years after the Empire service was started) plenty of Indians with shortwave sets don’t even know that the BBC broadcasts to India.</p>
<p>It is the same with the only other public activity I take part in, the Home Guard. After two years no real training has been done, no specialised tactics worked out, no battle positions fixed upon, no fortifications built – all this owing to endless changes of plan and complete vagueness as to what we are supposed to be aiming at. Details of organisation, battle positions etc. have been changed so frequently that hardly anyone knows at any given moment what the current arrangements are supposed to be. To give just one example, for well over a year our company has been trying to dig a system of trenches in Regents Park, in case airborne troops land there. Though dug over and over again these trenches have never once been in a completed state, because when they are half done there is always a change of plan and fresh orders. Ditto with everything. Whatever one undertakes, one starts with the knowledge that presently there will come a sudden change of orders, and then another change, and so on indefinitely. Nothing ever happens except continuous dithering, resulting in progressive disillusionment all round. The best one can hope is that it is much the same on the other side.</p>

				<p>No question now that the second front has been decided on. All the papers talk of it as a certainty and Moscow is publicising it widely. Whether it is really feasible remains to be seen, of course.</p>
<p>Cutting from BBC monitoring report. Typical of many similar German announcements.</p>
<p>Pasted sideways in the manuscript is the BBC monitoring report and his own typed report of the liquidation of Lidice. The texts are verbally the same. (See <em>CW</em>, XIII, p. 364).</p>

				<p>The most impressive fact about the Molotov visit is that the Germans knew nothing about it. Not a word on the radio about Molotov’s presence in London till the signature of the treaty was officially announced, although all the while the German radio was shouting about the bolshevisation of Britain. Obviously they would have split the beans if they had known. Taken on conjunction with certain other things (eg. The capture last year of two very amateurish spies dropped by parachute, with portable wireless transmitters and actually with chunks of German sausage in their suitcases) this suggests that the German spy system in this country cannot be up to much.</p>
<p>A sequence of four newspaper cuttings is pasted into the manuscript Diary at this point. For full details see <em>Complete Works</em>, XIII, pp. 362-3.;</p>
<ol>
<li>From editorial in <em>Tribune</em> of 12.6.42. on the death of Wm. Mellor. [1] Their idea of “Vigorous style”.</li>
<li>From Hitler’s speeches, quoted <em>in Reynold’s</em> [2] of 21.6.42.</li>
<li><em>Tribune</em> of 12.6.42. (article by Wilfred Macartney). Cf. prewar references to axis censorship, radio hypnosis etc. Cf. also German official statements in the Cologne raid.</li>
<li>How we live in 1942 (cutting from <em>E. Standard</em>: Illustration of five women, captioned ‘Russia’s Tommy-Gun Girls are Ready to Fight.’</li>
</ol>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Mellor">William Mellor</a> (1888-1942), left-wing journalist and author, edited the Daily Herald, which he had joined in 1903, from 1926 to 1930. He was then Assistant Managing Editor of Odhams Press until he became editor of Tribune, 1 January 1937. He wrote Direct Action (1920) and, with G.D.H. Cole, The Meaning of Industrial Freedom (1918). He was a member of the National Council of the Socialist League.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] Reynold’s News was a Labour-inclined Sunday newspaper: see Diary of Events Leading up to the War, 3.9.39, n. 2</em></p>

				<p>[<em>The Germans announce over the wireless that as the inhabitant of a Czech village called Ladice° (about 1200 inhabitants) were guilty of harbouring the assassins of Heydrich they have shot all the males in the village, sent all the women to concentration camps, sent all the children to be “re-educated”, razed the whole village to the ground and changed its name. I am keeping a copy of the announcement, as recorded in the BBC morning report.</em>]</p>
<p>From the BBC monitoring report: &#8211;</p>
<p align="center">PRAGUE (CZECH HOME STATIONS). IN GERMAN FOR PROTECTORATE. 10.6.42</p>
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Heydrich Revenge: Village Wiped Out: All Men Shot: ANNOUNCEMENT</span></p>
<p>It is officially announced: The search and investigation for the murderers of S.S. Obergruppenfuehrer Gen. Heydrich [1] has established unimpeachable indications (<em>sic</em>) that the population of the locality of Lidice, near Kladno, supported and gave assistance to the circle (<em>sic</em>) of perpetrators in question. In spite of the interrogation of the local inhabitants, the pertinent means of evidence were secured without the help of the population. The attitude of the inhabitants to the outrage thus manifested, is manifested also by other acts hostile to the Reich, by the discoveries of printed matter hostile to the Reich, of dumps of arms and ammunition, of an illegal wireless transmitter, of huge quantities of controlled goods, as well as by the fact that inhabitants of the locality are in active enemy service abroad. Since the inhabitants of this village (<em>sic</em>) have flagrantly violated the laws which have been issued, by their activity and by the support given to the murderers of S.S. Obergruppenfuehrer Heydrich, the male adults have been shot, the women have been sent to a concentration camp and the children have been handed over to the appropriate educational authorities. The buildings of the locality have been levelled to the ground, and the name of the community has been obliterated.</p>
<p>(Note: This is an identical repetition, in German, of an announcement made in Czech, from Prague at 19.00, when reception was very bad).</p>
<p>It does not particularly surprise me that people do this kind of thing, nor even that they announce that they are doing them. What does impress me, however, is that other people’s reaction to such happenings is governed solely by the political fashion of the moment. Thus before the war the pinks believed any and every horror story that came out of Germany or China. Now the pinks no longer believe in German or Japanese atrocities and automatically write off all horror stories as “propaganda”. In a little while you will be jeered at if you suggest that they story of Lidice could possibly be true. And yet there the facts are, announced by the Germans themselves and recorded on gramophone discs which no doubt will still be available. Cf. the long list of atrocities from 1914 onwards [German atrocities in Belgium, Bolshevik atrocities, Turkish atrocities, British atrocities in India, American atrocities in Nicaragua, Nazi atrocities, Italian atrocities in Abyssinia and Cyrenaica, red and white atrocities in Spain, Japanese atrocities in China [2] &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; ] in every case believed in or disbelieved in according to  political predilection, with utter non-interest in the facts and with complete willingness to alter one’s beliefs as soon as the political scene alters.</p>

<p>et seq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhard_Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> (1904-1942), head of the Reich Main Security Office (the Gestapo, criminal police, and SS Security Service), deputy to Heinrich Himmler, leading organiser of the Nazi ‘final solution,’ was appointed ‘Protector of Bohemia and Moravia’ in September 1941. On 27 May 1942, he was wounded by Czech patriots trained in England and died on 4 June. In reprisal, the village of Lidice was ‘exterminated.’ The population had been about 2,000, very few survived. Humphrey Jennings made a deeply moving film of the incident, as if it had occurred in the Welsh village of Ystradgynlais (The Silent Village, 1943), as part of the British government’s propaganda towards the defeat of Nazism. A copy of the pamphlet describing the film is in Orwell’s collection of pamphlets, now in the British Library. Throughout his manuscript, Orwell spells the village ‘Ladice.’</em></p>
<p><em>[2] Orwell had written to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Qian">Hsiao Ch’ien</a> on 14 January 1942 asking for ‘one talk on the ordinary atrocity lines’ in connection with the Japanese invasion of China. This was broadcast on 26 February 1942.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] The manuscript and typewritten versions differ slightly. Thus, as well as the White Sea Canal, Orwell includes the Ukraine famine, and as well as Abyssinia he includes Cyrenaica, and Nanking is specifically listed as a Japanese atrocity. Against British atrocities he includes the SS Dunera.</em></p>
<p><em>Under the Government Regulation 18B, because of exaggerated fears that amongst those who had come to Britain as refugees, especially from Nazi Germany, there were concealed spies and saboteurs, thousands of innocent people were interned on the Isle of Man. Although bitterly ironic, this hardly amounted to an atrocity in the grim scale of such horrors. The deporting of Jews on the S.S. Dunera to Australia on similar grounds was also misconceived, and led to treatment that was cruel as well as stupid. </em></p>

				<p>The only time when one hears people singing in the BBC is in the early morning, between 6 and 8. That is the time when the charwomen are at work. A huge army of them arrives all at the same time, they sit in the reception hall waiting from their brooms to be issued to them and making as much noise as a parrot house, and then they have wonderful choruses, all singing together as they sweep the passages. The place has a quite different atmosphere at this time from what it has later in the day.</p>

				<p>The <em>Sunday Express</em> has also gone cold on the second front. The official line now appears to be that our air raids are a second front. Obviously there has been some kind of government handout to the papers, telling them to pipe down on this subject. [<em>If the government merely wishes to stop them spreading misleading rumours, the puzzle is why they weren’t silenced earlier.</em>] It is just possible that the invasion has now been definitely decided on and the papers have been told to go anti-second front in order to throw the enemy off the scent. In this labyrinth of lies in which we are living the one explanation one never believes is the obvious one. [<em>Cf. David Astor’s story about the two German Jews meeting in the train: </em></p>
<p><em>First Jew. Where are you going to?</em></p>
<p><em>Second Jew. Berlin.</em></p>
<p><em>First Jew. Liar! You just say that to deceive me. You know that if you say you are going to Berlin I shall think you are going to Leipzig, and all the time, you dirty crook, you really are going to Berlin!’</em>]</p>
<p>Last Tuesday [2 June 1942] spent a long evening with Cripps (who had expressed a desire to meet some literary people) together with Empson, Jack Common, David Owen, Norman Cameron, Guy Burgess [1] and another man (an official) whose name I didn’t get. About 2 ½ hours of it, with nothing to drink. The usual inconclusive discussion. Cripps, however, very human and willing to listen. The person who stood up to him most successfully was Jack Common. Cripps said several things that amazed and slightly horrified me. One was that many people whose opinion was worth considering believed that the war would be over by October – ie. that Germany would be flat out by that time. When I said that I should look on that as a disaster pure and simple (because if the war were won as easily as that there would have been no real upheaval here and the American millionaires would still be in situ) he appeared not to understand. He said that once the war was won the surviving great powers would in any case have to administer the world as a unit, and seemed not to feel that it made much difference whether the great powers were capitalist or socialist.* [<em>Both David Owen and the man whose name I don’t know supported him.</em>] I saw that I was up against the official mind, which sees everything as a problem in administration and does not grasp that at a certain point, ie. when certain economic interest are menaced, public spirit ceases to function. [The <em>basic assumption of such people is that everyone wants the world to function properly and will do his best to keep the wheels running. They don’t realise that most of those who have the power don’t care a damn about the world as a whole and are only intent on feathering their own nests.</em>] I can’t help feeling a strong impression that Cripps has already been got at. Not with money or anything of that kind of course, nor even by flattery and the sense of power, which in all probability he genuinely doesn’t care about: but simply by responsibility, which automatically makes a man timid. Besides, as soon as you are in power your perspectives are foreshortened. Perhaps a bird’s eye view is as distorted as a worm’s eye view.</p>
<p>[<em>Wintringham denies being “Thomas Rainboro’ “, I think perhaps with truth. If not Wintringham, it might be Lord Winster (Commander Fletcher) </em>[2] ]</p>
<p>*<em>Very interesting but perhaps rather hard on Cripps to report an impression like this from a private interview</em> [Orwell’s handwritten footnote on typescript].</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Empson">William Empson</a> (1906-83; Kt., 1979), poet, critic, and, before the war, Professor of English, Tokyo and Peking. Like Orwell, he worked for the BBC’s Eastern Service but broadcast to China. He was Professor of English Literature, Sheffield University, 1953-71. He had already achieved scholarly recognition with Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930), and Some Versions of Pastoral (1935); among later writings was The Structure of Complex Words (1951). His obituary in The Times described him as ‘the most famously over-sophisticated man of his time who revolutionised our ways of reading a poem’.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Common">Jack Common</a> (1903-68), a worker from Tyneside employed by The Adelphi, first as a circulation pusher from June 1930, then as assistant editor, from 1932. He and Orwell became friends and he stayed in the Orwell’s cottage at Wallington when they were in Marrakech. He achieved success with The Freedom of the Streets, which Orwell reviews on 16 June 1938 (CW, X, pp. 162-3). See also Orwell Remembered, pp. 139-43.</em></p>
<p><em>Arthur David Kemp Owen (1904-70) personal assistant to Sir Stafford Cripps, 19 February to 21 November 1942.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Cameron">Norman Cameron</a> (1905-53) was a friend and disciple of Robert Graves, with whom he and Alan Hodge edited Work in Hand (1942). His The Winter House and Other Poems was published in 1935. He also translated from French and German.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Burgess">Guy Burgess</a> (1911-63), educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, was a good talker and a man of considerable gifts, which to used to proselytise the cause of Communism. He worked for the British security services and the BBC (as Home Service talks producer) and then joined the Foreign Office. His pro-Soviet activities were not suspected until, in May 1951, he suddenly left with Donald Maclean for Moscow remaining there until his death.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] Lord Winster (Commander R. T. H. Fletcher, 1885-1961), Liberal M.P., 1923-24; of the Admiralty, May 1940-December 1941. The pseudonym ‘Rainsborough’ was then being used by Frank Owen. </em></p>

				<p>The Molotov rumour still persists. He was here to negotiate the treaty, and has gone back, so it is said. No hint of this in any newspaper, however.</p>
<p>There is said to be much disagreement on the staff of the <em>New Statesman</em> over the question of the Second Front. [1] Having squealed for a year that we must open a second front immediately, Kingsley Martin [2] now has cold feet. He says they now say that the army cannot be trusted, the soldiers will shoot their officers in the back etc. – this after endeavouring throughout the war to make the soldiers mistrust their officers. Meanwhile I think now that a second front is definitely projected, at any rate if enough shipping can be scrapped together.</p>
<p><em>[1] At this time the opening of a second front was almost daily expected. When Dwight D. Eisenhower’s arrival in England was reported in the Daily Express on 26 June 1942, his photograph was headlined: ‘U.S. Second front general is here.’ Although, in response to Stalin’s demand that a Second Front be opened, consideration was given to a cross-Channel landing in August or September 1942, the first new front (not regarded by most people as a Second Front) was not opened until 8 November 1942, and then in North Africa.  </em></p>
<p><em>[2] Kingsley Martin (1897-1969) left-wing journalist and editor of The New Statesman (1931-60), caused the Indian Section considerable trouble, from what he said and from his squabbling about fees. He was regarded as unreliable by the BBC for not sticking to censored scripts, and was, in effect, barred by the Home Office and Ministry of Information because of his contribution to ‘Answering You,’ broadcast to North America in December 1941. </em></p>
