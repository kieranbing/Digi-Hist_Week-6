				<p>Horribly depressed by the way things are turning out. Went this morning for my medical board and was turned down, my grade being C., in which they aren’t at present taking any men in any corps&#8230;. what is appalling is the unimaginativeness of a system which can find <em>no </em>use for a man who is below the average level of fitness but at least is not an invalid. An army needs an immense amount of clerical work, most of which is done by people who are perfectly healthy and only half-literate&#8230; One could forgive the government for failing to employ the intelligentsia, who on the whole are politically unreliable, if they were making any attempt to mobilise the manpower of the nation and change people from the luxury trades to productive work. This simply isn’t happening, as one can see by looking down any street.</p>
<p>The Russians entered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessarabia#World_War_II" target="_blank">Bessarabia </a>today. Practically no interest aroused, and the few remarks I could overhear were mildly approving or at least nor hostile. Cf. the intense popular anger over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War" target="_blank">the invasion of Finland</a>. I don’t think the difference is due to a perception that Finland and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania#World_Wars_and_Greater_Romania" target="_blank">Rumania</a> are different propositions. It is probably because of our own desperate straits and the notion that this move may embarrass Hitler – as I believe it must, though evidently sanctioned by him.</p>

				<p>It appears that the night before last, during the air-raid alarm, many people all over London were woken by the All Clear signal, took that for a warning and went to the shelters and stayed there till morning, waiting for the All Clear. This after ten months of war and God knows how many explanations of the air-raid precautions.</p>
<p>The fact that the government hasn’t this time had to do a recruiting campaign has had a deadening effect on propaganda&#8230;. A striking thing is the absence of any propaganda posters of a general kind, dealing with the struggle against Fascism etc. If only someone would show the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Information_%28United_Kingdom%29" target="_blank">M.O.I.</a> the posters used in the Spanish war, even the Franco ones for that matter. But how can these people possibly rouse the nation <em>against </em>Fascism when they themselves are subjectively pro-Fascist and were buttering up Mussolini till almost the moment when Italy entered the war? Butler[1], answering questions about the Spanish occupation of Tangier, says H.M. Government has “accepted the word” of the Spanish government that the Spaniards are only doing so in order to preserve Tangier’s neutrality – this after Falangist demonstrations in Madrid to celebrate the ‘conquest’ of Tangier&#8230;. This morning’s papers publish a “denial” that Hoare[2] in Madrid is asking questions about an armistice. In other words he <em>is </em>doing so. Only question – can we get rid of these people in the next few weeks, before it is too late?</p>
<p>The unconscious treacherousness of the British ruling class in what is in effect a class war is too obvious to be worth mentioning. The difficult question is how much <em>deliberate</em> treachery exists&#8230;. L.M.[3], who knows or at least has met all these people, says that with individual exceptions like Churchill the entire British aristocracy is utterly corrupt and lacking in the most ordinary patriotism, caring in fact for nothing except preserving their own standard of life. He says that they are also intensely class-conscious and recognise clearly the community of their interests with those of rich people elsewhere. The idea that Mussolini might fall has always been a nightmare to them, he says. Up to date L.M’s predictions about the war, made the day it began, have been very correct. He said nothing would happen all winter, Italy would be treated with great respect and then suddenly come in against us, and the German aim would be to force on Britain a puppet government through which Hitler could rule Britain without the mass of the public grasping what was happening&#8230;. The only point where L.M proved wrong is that like myself he assumed Russia would continue to collaborate with Germany, which now looks as if it may not happen. But then the Russians probably did not expect France to collapse so suddenly. If they can bring it off, Pétain and Co. are working towards the same kind of double cross against Russia as Russia previously worked against England. It was interesting that at the time of the Russo-German pact nearly everyone assumed that the pact was all to Russia’s advantage and that Stalin had in some way “stopped” Hitler, though one only had to look at the map in order to see that this was not so&#8230;.In western Europe Communism and left extremism generally are now almost entirely a form of masturbation. People who are in fact without power over events console themselves by pretending that they are in some way controlling events. From the Communist point of view, nothing matters so long as they can persuade themselves that Russia is on top. It now seems doubtful whether the Russians gained much more from the pact than a breathing-space, though they did this much better than we did at Munich. Perhaps England and the U.S.S.R. will be forced into alliance after all, an interesting instance of real interests overriding the most hearty ideological hatred.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Leader" target="_blank"><em>New Leader</em></a>[4] is now talking about the “betrayal” by Pétain and Co. and the “workers’ struggle” against Hitler. Presumably they would be in favour of a “worker’s” resistance if Hitler invaded England. And what will the workers fight with? With weapons. Yet the I.L.P. clamour simultaneously for sabotage in the arms factories. These people live almost entirely in a masturbation fantasy, conditioned by the fact that nothing they say or do will ever influence events, not even the turning-out of a single shell.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Last night an air raid warning about 1 a.m. It was a false alarm as regards London, but evidently there was a real raid somewhere. We got up and dressed, but did not go to the shelter. This is what everyone did, i.e. got up and then simply stood about talking, which seems very foolish. But it seems natural to get up when one hears a siren, and then in the absence of gunfire or other excitement one is ashamed to go to the shelter.</p>
<p>I saw in one of yesterday’s papers that gas masks are being issued in America, though people have to pay for them. Gas masks are probably useless to the civilian population in England and almost certainly in America. The issue of them is simply a symbol of national solidarity, the first step towards wearing a uniform. . . . As soon as war started the carrying or not carrying of a gas mask assumed social and political implications. In the first few days people like myself who refused to carry one were stared at and it was generally assumed that the non-carriers were “left”. Then the habit wore off, and the assumption was that a person who carried a gas mask was of the ultra-cautious type, the suburban rate-payer type. With the bad news the habit has revived and I should think 20 per cent now carry them. But you are still a little stared at if you carry one without being in uniform. Until the big raids have happened and it is grasped that the Germans don’t, in fact, use gas, the extent to which masks are carried will probably be a good index of the impression the war news is making on the public.</p>
<p>Went this afternoon to the recruiting office to put my name down for the Home Service Battalions. Have to go again on Friday to be medically examined, but as it is for men from 30 to 50 I suppose the standards are low. The man who took my name, etc., was the usual imbecile, an old soldier with medals of the last war, who could barely write. In writing capital letters he more than once actually wrote them upside down.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The German armistice terms are much as expected. . . . What is interesting about the whole thing is the extent to which the traditional pattern of loyalties and honour is breaking down. Pétain, ironically enough, is the originator (at Verdun) of the phrase “ils ne passeront pas”, so long an anti-Fascist slogan. Twenty years ago any Frenchman who would have signed such an armistice would have had to be either an extreme leftwinger or an extreme pacifist, and even then there would have been misgivings. Now the people who are virtually changing sides in the middle of the war are the professional patriots. To Pétain, Laval[1], Flandin[2] and Co. the whole war must have seemed like a lunatic internecine struggle at the moment when your real enemy is waiting to slosh you. . . . It is therefore practically certain that high-up influences in England are preparing for a similar sell-out, and while e.g. &#8212; is at &#8212; there is no certainty that they won’t succeed even without the invasion of England. The one good thing about the whole business is that the bottom is being knocked out of Hitler’s pretence of being the poor man’s friend. The people actually willing to do a deal with him are bankers, generals, bishops, kings, big industrialists, etc., etc. . . . . Hitler is a leader of tremendous counterattack of the capitalist class, which is forming itself into a vast corporation, losing its privileges to some extent in doing so, but still retaining its power over the working class. When it comes to resisting such an attack as this, anyone who is <em>of</em> the capitalist class must be treacherous or half-treacherous, and will swallow the most fearful indignities rather than put up a real fight. . . . whichever way one looks, whether it is at the wider strategic aspects or the most petty details of local defence, one sees that any real struggle means revolution. Churchill evidently can’t see or won’t accept this, so he will have to go. But whether he goes in time to save England from conquest depends on how quickly the people at large can grasp the essentials. What I fear is that they will never move until it is too late.</p>
<p>Strategically, all turns upon hanging on until the winter. . . . By that time, which huge armies of occupation everywhere, food almost certainly running short and the difficulty of forcing the conquered populations to work, Hitler must be in an awkward position. It will be interesting to see whether he rehabilitates the suppressed French Communist party and tries to use it against the working class in northern France as he used Pétain against the Blimp class.</p>
<p>If the invasion happens and fails, all is well, and we shall have a definitely leftwing government and a conscious movement against the governing class. I think, though, people are in error in imagining that Russia would be more friendly towards us if we had a revolutionary government. After Spain, I cannot help feeling that Russia, i.e. Stalin, must be hostile to any country that is genuinely undergoing revolution. They would be moving in opposite directions. A revolution starts off with wide diffusion of the ideas of liberty, equality, etc. Then comes the growth of an oligarchy which is as much interested in holding onto its privileges as any other governing class. Such an oligarchy must necessarily be hostile to revolutions elsewhere, which inevitably re-awaken the ideas of liberty and equality. This morning’s <em>News-Chronicle</em> announces that saluting of superior ranks has been re-instituted in the Red Army. A revolutionary army would <em>start</em> by abolishing saluting, and this tiny point is symptomatic of the whole situation. Not that saluting and such things are not probably necessary.</p>
<p>Orders to the L.D.V. that <em>all</em> revolvers are to be handed over to the police, as they are needed for the army. Clinging to useless weapons like revolvers, when the Germans have submachine guns, is typical of the British army, but I believe the real reason for the order is to prevent weapons from getting into “the wrong” hands.</p>
<p>Both E. and G.[3] insistent that I should go to Canada if the worst comes to the worst, in order to stay alive and keep up propaganda. I will go if I have some function, e.g., if the government were transferred to Canada and I had some kind of job, but not as a refugee, nor as an expatriate journalist squealing from a safe distance. There are too many of these exiled “anti-fascists” already. Better to die if necessary, and maybe even as propaganda one’s death might achieve more than going abroad and living more or less unwanted on other people’s charity. Not that I want to die; I have so much to live for, in spite of poor health and having no children.</p>
<p>Another government leaflet this morning, on treatment of air-raid casualties. The leaflets are getting much better in tone and language, and the broadcasts are also better, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_Cooper" target="_blank">Duff-Cooper</a>’s, which in fact are ideal for anyone down to the £5-a-week level. But there is still nothing in really demotic speech, nothing that will move the poorer working class or even be quite certainly intelligible. Most educated people simply don’t realise how little impression abstract words make on the average man. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Acland" target="_blank">Acland</a> was sending round his asinine “Manifesto of Plain Men” (written by himself and signed on the dotted line by “plain men” whom he selected) he told me he had the first draft vetted by the Mass Observers, who tried it on working men, and found that the most fantastic misunderstandings arose. . . . The first sign that things are really happening in England will be the disappearance of that horrible plummy voice from the radio. Watching in public bars, I have noticed that working men only pay attention to the broadcasts when some bit of demotic speech creeps in[4]. E. however claims, with some truth I think, that uneducated people are often moved by a speech in solemn language which they don’t actually understand but feel to be impressive. E.g. Mrs A.[5] is impressed by Churchill’s speeches, though not understanding them word for word.</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Laval" target="_blank">Pierre Laval (1883-1945)</a> served at various times as French Minister of Public Works, Justice, Labour, Colonies, and Foreign Affairs, and was Premier, 1931-32, 1935-36. He left the Socialist Party in 1920 and gradually moved to the extreme right. On 7 January 1935, as Foreign Minister, he signed an agreement with Mussolini that backed Italian claims to areas of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in return for Italian support against German intervention in Austria. Italy invaded Abyssinia on 3 October 1935, and on 18 December the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had entered into a pact with Laval appeasing Mussolini. After the fall of France, Laval came to represent treacherous collaboration. He even provided Frenchmen for work in German industry. Tried in 1945, he was executed after failing in a suicide attempt.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-%C3%89tienne_Flandin" target="_blank">Pierre-Etienne Flandin</a> (1889-1958) held numerous offices in French governments. He was Premier, 1934-35, and Foreign Minister in Pétain’s government in 1940, but attempted to resist German demands and was replaced by Laval. He was forbidden to participate in public life after the war.</em></p>

<p><em>[4] See <a href="https://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/28-5-40/" target="_blank">28.5.40</a> for lack of interest in news broadcasts</em></p>
<p><em> [5] Probably Mrs Anderson, who cleaned for the Orwells in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?gl=uk&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101812867577307634528.000453f255c69c417647b&amp;ll=51.987536,-0.119991&amp;spn=0.005761,0.013797&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=000467c0a152a8a090135" target="_blank">Wallington</a>. Although Orwell had, by the time this was written, been living in London for five or six weeks, he still visited Wallington. The Stores was not given up completely until 1947. </em>Peter Davison</p>

				<p>No real news yet of the German terms to France. They are said to be “so complicated” as to need long discussion. I suppose one may assume that what is really happening is that the Germans on the one side and Petain[1] and Co. on the other are trying to hammer out a formula that will induce the French commanders in the colonies and the navy to surrender. Hitler has in reality no power over those except through the French government&#8230;.I think we have all been rather hasty in assuming that Hitler will now invade England, indeed it has been so generally expected that one might almost infer from this that he wouldn’t do it&#8230;.If I were him I should march across Spain, seize Gibraltar, and then clean up North Africa and Egypt. If the British have a fluid force of say ¼ million men, the proper course would be to transfer it to French Morocco, then suddenly seize Spanish Morocco and hoist the Republican flag. The other Spanish colonies could be mopped up without much trouble. Alas, no hope of any such thing happening.</p>
<p>The Communists are apparently swinging back to an anti-Nazi position. This morning picked up a leaflet denouncing the “betrayal” of France by Petain and Co., although till a week or two ago these people were almost openly pro-German.</p>
<p><em>[1] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/petain_philippe.shtml" target="_blank">Henri Philippe Petain (1856-1951)</a>, successful defender of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun" target="_blank">Verdun</a> in 1916, which led to his being regarded as a national hero, was created a Marshal of France in 1918. He became premier in 1940, presided over the defeat and dismemberment of France by the Germans, and led the occupied zone’s Vichy government until war’s end. He was tried for collaboration with the Nazis and sentenced to death. President de Gaulle commuted his sentence to solitary confinement for life. </em>Peter Davison</p>

				<p>No real news. I see from yesterday’s paper that Chiappe[1] has been elected president of the Paris Municipal Council, presumably under German pressure. So much for the claim that Hitler is the friend of the working classes, enemy of plutocracy, etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday the first drill of our platoon of the L.D.V. They were really admirable, only 3 or 4 in the whole lot (about 60 men) who were not old soldiers. Some officers who were there and had, I think, come to scoff were quite impressed.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Went to the office of the [<em>New Statesman</em>][1] to see what line they are taking about home defence. C.[2], who is now in reality the big noise there, was rather against the “arm the people” line and said that its dangers outweighed its possible advantages[3]. If a German invading force finds civilians armed it may commit such barbarities as will cow the people altogether and make everyone anxious to surrender. He said it was dangerous to count on ordinary people being courageous and instanced the case of some riot in Glasgow when a tank was driven round the town and everyone fled in the most cowardly way. The circumstances were different, however, because the people in that case were unarmed and, as always in internal strife, conscious of fighting with ropes round their necks&#8230; C. said that he thought Churchill, though a good man up to a point, was incapable of doing the necessary thing and turning this into a revolutionary war, and for that reason Chamberlain and Co. hesitated to bring the whole nation into the struggle. I don’t of course think Churchill sees it in quite the same colours as we do, but I don’t think he would jib at any step (e.g. equalisation of incomes, independence for India) which he thought necessary for winning the war. Of course it’s possible that today’s secret session may achieve enough to get Chamberlain and Co. out for good. I asked C. what hope he thought there was of this, and he said none at all. But I remember that the day the British began to evacuate Namsos[4] I asked <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bevan_aneurin.shtml" target="_blank">Bevan</a> and Strauss[5], who had just come from the House, what hope there was of this business unseating Chamberlain, and they also said none at all. Yet a week or so later the new government was formed[6].</p>
<p>The belief in direct treachery in the higher command is now widespread, enough so to be dangerous&#8230; Personally I believe that such conscious treachery as exists is only in the pro-Fascist element of the aristocracy and perhaps in the Army command. Of course the unconscious sabotage and stupidity which have got us into this situation, e.g. the idiotic handling of Italy and Spain, is a different matter. R.H.[7] says that private soldiers back from Dunkirk whom he has spoken to all complain of the conduct of their officers, saying that the latter cleared off in cars and left them in the soup, etc., etc. This sort of thing is always said after a defeat and may or may not be true. One could verify it by studying the lists of casualties, if and when they are published in full. But it is not altogether bad that that sort of thing should be said, provided it doesn’t lead to sudden panic, because of the absolute need for getting the whole thing onto a new class basis. In the new armies middle-class people are bound to predominate as officers, they did so even, for instance, in the Spanish militias, but it is a question of unblimping. Ditto with the L.D.V. Under the stress of emergency we shall unblimp if we have time, but time is all [8].</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me yesterday: how is it that England, with one of the smallest armies in the world, has so many retired colonels?</p>
<p>I notice that all the “left” intellectuals I meet believe that Hitler if he gets here will take the trouble to shoot people like ourselves and will have very extensive lists of undesirables. C.[9] says there is a move on foot to get our police records (no doubt we all have them) at Scotland Yard destroyed[10]. Some hope! The police are the very people who would go over to Hitler once they were certain he had won. Well, if only we can hold out for a few months, in a year’s time we shall see red militia billeted in the Ritz[11], and it would not particularly surprise me to see Churchill or Lloyd George at the head of them.</p>
<p>Thinking always of my island in the Hebrides[12], which I suppose I shall never possess nor even see. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton_Mackenzie" target="_blank">Compton Mackenzie</a> says even now most of the islands are uninhabited (there are 500 of them, only 10 per cent inhabited at normal times), and most have water and a little cultivable land, and goats will live on them. According to R.H., a woman who rented an island in the Hebrides on order to avoid air raids was the first air raid casualty of the war, the RAF dropping a bomb there by mistake. Good if true.</p>
<p>The first air raid of any consequence on Great Britain the night before last. Fourteen killed, seven German aeroplanes claimed shot down. The papers have photos of three wrecked German planes, so possibly the claim is true.</p>
<p><em>[1] ‘New Statesman’ seems probable here, though the diary has five hyphens.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] Probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crossman" target="_blank">Richard Crossman</a> (1907-1974), scholar, intellectual, journalist, and left-wing politician, who was assistant editor of </em>The New Statesman<em>, 1938-55, and editor, 1970-72. He was also a Labour MP, 1945-1970; Minister of Housing and Local Government, 1964-66, and Minister of Health and Social Security, 1964-70</em></p>
<p><em>[3] See Orwell’s ‘London Letter’ in </em>Partisan Review<em>, March-April 1941, 740</em></p>
<p><em>[4] The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/146th_Infantry_Brigade_%28United_Kingdom%29" target="_blank">British 146<sup>th</sup> Infantry Brigade</a> landed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namsos_Campaign" target="_blank">Namsos, Norway</a>, on the coast some 300 miles north of Oslo, on 16-17 April 1940. They withdrew 2-3 May. The last Allied forces left Norway on 9 June.</em></p>
<p><em>[5] In 1949 Orwell said to a friend, ‘If only I could become Nye’s </em><em>eminence grise we’d soon have this country on its feet’. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lord-strauss-1490546.html" target="_blank">G.R. Strauss</a> (1901-1993; Life Peer 1979) was a Labour MP and co-director of </em><em>Tribune.</em></p>
<p><em>[6] Neville Chamberlain’s government fell on 10 May 1940 and a coalition government under Winston Churchill was formed. Magnanimously, Churchill included Chamberlain in his cabinet.</em></p>
<p><em>[7] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayner_Heppenstall" target="_blank">Rayner Heppenstall</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>[8] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blimp" target="_blank">‘Unblimping&#8217;</a> was a frequent concern of Orwell’s. See, for example, ‘Democracy in the British Army’ (1939), ‘War Time Diary’ (23.8.40), ‘The Home Guard and You’ (1940), ‘Don’t Let Colonel Blimp Ruin the Home Guard’ (1941), review of </em>Home Guard for Victory!<em> (1941), ‘London Letter’</em><em>, </em>Partisan Review<em>, July-August 1941, November-December 1941, ‘Three Years of Home Guard’ (9 May 1943), ‘Home Guard Lessons for the Future’ (15 October 1944)</em></p>
<p><em>[9] Not certainly identified. Possibly Richard Crossman again or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Connolly" target="_blank">Cyril Connolly</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inez_Holden" target="_blank">Inez Holden</a> suggested either Christopher Hollis or a mysterious man known as Carter, whom Orwell’s friends never met.</em></p>
<p><em>[10] See ‘London Letter’, </em>Partisan Review<em>, March-April 1941</em></p>
<p><em>[11] See ‘My Country Right or Left’</em></p>
<p><em>[12] This is the first reference to Orwell’s dream of living in the Hebrides, to be realised in 1945 when he rented Barnhill, on Jura. Compare Winston Smith’s version of ‘the Golden Country’ in </em>Nineteen Eighty-Four<em>; see also Orwell’s review of </em>Priest Island<em>, 640</em><em>. </em>Peter Davison</p>
