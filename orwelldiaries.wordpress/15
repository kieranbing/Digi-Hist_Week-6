				<p>The budget has almost knocked the Balkan campaign out of the news. It is the former and not the latter that I overhear people everywhere discussing. [1]</p>
<p>This evening’s news has the appearance of being very bad. The Greek C. in C. has issued a statement that the Serbs have retreated and uncovered his left flank. The significance of this is that people don’t officially say things like that – practically a statement that the Serbs have let the Greeks down – unless they feel things to be going very badly.</p>
<p>The Home Guard now have tommy guns, at any rate two per company. It seems a far cry from the time when we were going to be armed with shotguns – only there weren’t any shotguns – and my question as to whether we might hope for some machine guns was laughed off as an absurdity.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Have just read <em>The Battle of Britain</em>, the M.O.I.’s best-seller (there was so great a run on it that copies were unprocurable for some days). It is said to have been compiled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Saint_George_Saunders">Francis Beeding</a>, the writer of thrillers. I suppose it is not as bad as it might be, but seeing that it is being translated into many languages and will undoubtedly be read all over the world – it is the first historical account, at any rate in English, of the first great air battle in history – it is a pity that they did not have the sense to avoid the propagandist note altogether. The pamphlet is full of “heroic”, “glorious exploits”, etc., and the Germans are spoken of more or less slightingly. Why couldn’t they simply give a cold accurate account of the facts, which after all are favourable enough? For the sake of the bit of cheer-up that this pamphlet will accomplish in England, they throw away the chance of producing something that would be accepted all over the world as a standard authority and used to counteract German lies.</p>
<p>But what chiefly impresses me when reading <em>The Battle of Britain</em> and looking up the corresponding dates in this diary, is the way in which “epic” events never seem very important at the time. Actually I have a number of vivid memories of the day the Germans broke through and fired the docks (<a href="https://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2010/09/10/10-9-40/">I think it must have been the 7<sup>th</sup> September</a>), but mostly of trivial things. First of all riding down in the bus to have tea with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Connolly">Connolly</a>, and two women in front of me insisting that shell-bursts in the sky were parachutes, till I had a hard job of it not to chip in and correct them. Then sheltering in a doorway in Piccadilly from falling shrapnel, just as one might shelter from a cloudburst. Then a long line of German planes filing across the sky, and some very young  R.A.F. and naval officers running out of one of the hotels and passing a pair of field glasses from hand to hand. Then sitting in Connolly’s top-floor flat [1] and watching the enormous fires beyond St. Paul’s, and the great plume of smoke from an oil drum somewhere down the river, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Slater">Hugh Slater</a> sitting in the window and saying, “It’s just like Madrid – quite nostalgic.” The only person suitably impressed was Connolly, who took us up to the roof and after gazing for some time at the fires, said “It’s the end of capitalism. It’s a judgment on us”. I didn’t feel this to be so, but I was chiefly struck by the size and beauty of the flames. That night I was woken up by the explosions and actually went out into the street to see if the fires were still alight – as a matter of fact it was almost as bright as day, even in the N.W. quarter – but still didn’t feel as though any important historical event were happening. Afterwards, when the attempt to conquer England by air bombardment had evidently been abandoned, I said to Fyvel, “That was Trafalgar. Now there’s Austerlitz”, [2] but I hadn’t seen this analogy at the time.</p>
<p>The <em>News Chronicle </em>very defeatist again, making a great outcry about the abandonment of Benghazi, with the implication that we ought to have gone for Tripoli while the going was good instead of withdrawing troops to use in Greece.[3] And these are exactly the people who would have raised the loudest squeal if we had gone on with the conquest of the Italian empire and left the Greeks in the soup.</p>
<p><em>[1] Cyril Connolly then had a furnished flat on the top floor of Athenaeum Court, Piccadilly, partly paid for by Peter Watson, sponsor of </em>Horizon<em>. For watching the raid from the roof-top on 7 September 1940, see Michael Shelden, </em>Friends of Promise<em>, p. 62. For Hugh Slater, see <a href="https://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/23-8-40/">War-time Diary, 23.8.40, n. 4</a></em></p>
<p><em>[2] Admiral Nelson defeated the French fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, but Napoleon nevertheless went on to victory at Austerlitz later that year, defeating the combined forces of Russia and Austria and forcing Austria out of the war. Hitler may have lost the Battle of London, Orwell was saying, but it must be expected that he would have subsequent victories elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] See <a href="https://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/14-3-41/">War-time Diary, 14.3.41, nn. 1 and 2.</a> Peter Davison</em></p>

				<p>Belgrade bombed yesterday, and the first official announcement this morning that there is a British army in Greece – 150,000 men, so they say. So the mystery of where the British army in Libya had gone to it at last cleared up, though this had been obvious enough when the British retreated from Benghazi. Impossible to say yet whether the treaty of friendship between Jugo-Slavia and the U.S.S.R. means anything or nothing, but it is difficult to believe that it doesn’t point to a worsening of Russo-German relations. One will get another indication of the Russian attitude when and if the Emperor of Abyssinia is restored – i.e., whether the Russian government recognises him and sends an ambassador to his court.</p>
<p>&#8230;Shortage of labour more and more apparent and prices of such things as textiles and furniture rising to a frightening extent &#8230;The secondhand furniture trade, after years of depression, is booming … It is evident that calling-up is now being consciously used as a way of silencing undesirables. The reserved age for journalists has been raised to 41 – this won’t bring them in more than a few hundred men, but can be used against individuals whenever desired. It would be comic if after having been turned down for the army on health grounds ten months ago it were suddenly found that my health had improved to just the point at which I was fit to be a private <a href="https://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/12-2-41/">in the Pioneers</a>.</p>
<p>&#8230;Thinking always of our army in Greece and the desperate risk it runs of being driven into the sea. One can imagine how the strategists of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._H._Liddell_Hart">Liddell Hart</a> [1] type must be wringing their hands over this rash move. Politically it is right, however, if one looks 2-3 years ahead. The best one can say is that even in the narrow strategic sense it must offer some hope of success, or the generals concerned would have refused to undertake it. It is difficult to feel that Hitler has not mistimed his stroke by a month or thereabouts. Abyssinia at any rate is gone, and the Italian naval disaster can hardly have been intended.[2] Also if war in the Balkans lasts even three months the effects on Germany’s food supply in the autumn must be serious.</p>

				<p>The reports of German heavy cruisers in the Atlantic somehow have the appearance of being a false rumour to draw British capital ships away. [1] That might conceivably be a prelude to invasion. Expectation of invasion has much faded away, because it is generally felt that Hitler could not now conquer England with any force he would be able to bring here, unless British sea and air power had been greatly worn down beforehand. I think this is probably so and that Hitler will not attempt invasion until he has had a spectacular success elsewhere, because the invasion itself would appear as a failure and would need something to offset it. But I think that an unsuccessful invasion meaning the loss of, say, 100,000 or even 500,000 men, might well do his job for him, because of the utter paralysis of industry and internal food-supply it might cause. If a few hundred thousand men could be landed and could hold out for even three weeks they would have done more damage than thousands of air-raids could do. But the effects of this would not be apparent immediately, and therefore Hitler is only likely to try it when things are going conspicuously well for him.</p>
<p>Evidently there is very serious shortage of Home Guard equipment, i.e. weapons. On the other hand, the captures of arms in Africa are said to be so enormous that experts are being sent out to inventory them. Drawings will then be made and fresh weapons manufactured to these specifications, the captured ones being sufficient as the nucleus for a whole new range of armaments.</p>
<p><em>[1] It was no false rumour. The pocket-battleship </em>Scheer<em> and the battlecruisers </em>Scharnhorst<em> and </em>Gneisenau<em> sank or captured seventeen ships about this time (long-range bombers sank 41; U-boats, 41). The battlecruisers reached Brest on 22 March but were then immobilized following British air attacks on the port. Peter Davison</em></p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Yesterday attended a more or less compulsory Home Guard church parade, to take part in the national day of prayer. There were also contingents of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_Fire_Service">A.F.S.</a>, Air Force cadets, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Auxiliary_Air_Force">W.A.A.F’s</a>, etc., etc. Appalled by the jingoism and self-righteousness of the whole thing&#8230;. I am not shocked by the Church condoning the war, as many people profess to be – nearly always people who are not religious believers themselves, I notice. If you accept government you accept war, and if you accept war you must in most cases desire one side or the other to win. I can never work up any disgust over bishops blessing the colours of regiments, etc. All that kind of thing is founded on a sentimental idea that fighting is incompatible with loving your enemies. Actually you can only love your enemies if you are willing to kill them in certain circumstances. But what is disgusting about services like these is the absence of any kind of self-criticism. Apparently God is expected to help us on the ground that we are <em>better</em> than the Germans. In the set prayer composed for the occasion God is asked “to turn the hearts of our enemies, and to help us to forgive them; to give them repentance for their misdoings, and a readiness to make amends.” Nothing about our enemies forgiving us. It seems to me that Christian attitude would be that we are no better than our enemies, we are all miserable sinners, but that it so happens that it would be better if our cause prevailed and therefore that it is legitimate to pray for this&#8230;&#8230;. I suppose the idea is that it would be bad for morale to let people realise that the enemy has a case, though even that is a psychological error, in my opinion. But perhaps they aren’t thinking primarily about the effect on the people taking part in the service but are simply looking for direct results from their nation-wide praying campaign, a sort of box barrage fired at the angels.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Fairly heavy raids last night, but only 1 plane brought down, so no doubt the rumours about a “secret weapon” are all baloney.</p>
<p>A lot of bombs at Greenwich, one of them while I was talking to E[ileen] over the &#8216;phone. A sudden pause in the conversation and a tinkling sound:</p>
<p>I. ‘What’s that?’</p>
<p>B. ‘Only the windows falling in.’ [1]</p>
<p>The bomb had dropped in the park opposite the house, broke the cable of the barrage balloon and wounded one of the balloon barrage men and a Home Guard. Greenwich church was on fire and the people still sheltering in the crypt with the fire burning overhead and water flowing down, making no move to get out till made to do so by the wardens.</p>
<p>German consul in Tangier (the first time since 1914). It appears that in deference to American opposition we are going to let more food into France. Even if some kind of neutral commission is set up to supervise this it will do no good to the French. The Germans will simply allow them to keep such wheat, etc., as we send in and withhold a corresponding quantity elsewhere. Even while we make ready to allow the food ships in, there is no sign of the government extorting anything in return – e.g., expulsion of German agents from North Africa. The proper course would be to wait till France is on the verge of starvation and the Pétain government consequently rocking, and then hand over a really large supply of food in return for some substantial concession, e.g. surrender of important units of the French fleet. Any such policy totally unthinkable at present, of course. If only one could be sure whether &#8212;-, &#8212;- and all their kind are really traitors, or only fools.</p>
<p>Looking back through this diary, I see that of late I have written in it at much longer intervals and much less about public events than when I started it. The feeling of helplessness is growing in everyone. One feels that the necessary swing of opinion cannot now happen except at the price of another disaster, which we cannot afford and which therefore one dare not hope for. The worst is that the crisis now coming is going to be a crisis of hunger, which the English people have no real experience of. Quite soon it is going to be a question of whether to import arms or food. It is a mercy that the worst period will come in the summer months, but it will be devilish difficult to get the people to face hunger when, so far as they can see, there is no purpose in the war whatever, and when the rich are still carrying on just as before, as they will be, of course, unless dealt with forcibly. It doesn’t matter having no war aims when it is a question of repelling invasion, because from the point of view of ordinary people keeping foreigners out of England is quite a sufficient war aim. But how can you ask them to starve their children in order to build tanks to fight in Africa, when in all that they are told at present there is nothing to make clear that fighting in Africa, or in Europe, has anything to do with the defence of England?</p>
<p>On a wall in South London some Communist or Blackshirt had chalked “Cheese, not Churchill”. What a silly slogan. It sums up the psychological ignorance of these people who even now have not grasped that whereas some people would die for Churchill, nobody will die for cheese.</p>

				<p>For the last few days there have been rumours everywhere, also hints in the papers, that “something is going to happen” in the Balkans, i.e. that we are going to send an expeditionary force to Greece.  If so, it must presumably be the army now in Libya, or the bulk of it.[1]  I had heard a month back that Metaxas [2] before he died asked us for 10 divisions and we offered him 4.  It seems a terribly dangerous thing to risk an army anywhere west of the Straits.  To have any worthwhile ideas about the strategy of such a campaign, one would have to know how many men <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell">Wavell</a> disposes of and how many are needed to hold Libya, how the shipping position stands, what the communications from Bulgaria into Greece are like, how much of their mechanised stuff the Germans have managed to bring across Europe, and who effectively controls the sea between Sicily and Tripoli.  It would be an appalling disaster if while our own main force was bogged in Salonika the Germans managed to cross the sea from Sicily and win back all the Italians have lost.  Everyone who thinks of the matter is torn both ways.  To place an army in Greece is a tremendous risk and doesn’t offer much <em>positive</em> gain, except that once Turkey is involved our warships can enter the Black Sea: on the other hand if we let Greece down we have demonstrated once and for all that we can’t and won’t help any European nation to keep its independence.  The thing I fear most is half-hearted intervention and a ghastly failure, as in Norway.  I am in favour of putting all our eggs in one basket and risking a big defeat, because I don’t think any defeat or victory in the narrow military sense matters so much as demonstrating that we are the side of the weak against the strong.</p>
<p>The trouble is that it becomes harder and harder to understand the reactions of European peoples, just as they seem incapable of understanding ours.  Numbers of Germans I have spoken to have exclaimed on our appalling mistake at the beginning of the war in not bombing Berlin promptly but merely scattering fatuous leaflets.[3]  Yet I believe <em>all</em> English people were delighted at this gesture (we should still have been so if we had known at the time what drivel the leaflets were), because we saw it as a demonstration that we had no quarrel with the common people of Germany.  On the other hand, in his book which we have just published, Haffner [4] exclaims that it is folly on our part to let the Irish withhold vitally important bases and that we should simply take these bases without more ado.  He says that the spectacle of our allowing a sham-independent country like Ireland to defy us simply makes all Europe laugh at us.  There you have the European outlook, with its non-understanding of the English-speaking peoples.  Actually, if we took the Irish bases by force, without a long course of propaganda  beforehand, the effect on public opinion, not only in the U.S.A. but <em>in England</em>, would be disastrous.</p>
<p>I don’t like the tone of official utterances about Abyssinia.  They are mumbling about having a British “resident”, as at the courts of Indian rajahs, when the Emperor is restored.  The effect may be appalling if we let it be even plausibly <em>said</em> that we are swiping Abyssinia for ourselves.  If the Italians are driven right out [5] we may have the chance to make the most tremendous gesture, demonstrating beyond argument that we are not simply fighting for our own hand.  It would echo all round the world.  But will they have the guts or decency to make it?  One can’t feel certain.  One can foresee the specious arguments that will be put forward for grabbing Abyssinia for ourselves, the rot about slavery, etc., etc.</p>
<p>A considerable number of German planes shot down in the last few nights, probably because they have been clear nights and favourable to the fighters, but there is much excitement about some “secret weapon” that is said to be in use.  The popular rumour is that it is a net made of wire which is shot into the air and in which the aeroplane becomes entangled.[6]</p>
<p><em>[1] On 12 February, Churchill, in the same telegram in which he congratulated General Wavell on the capture of Benghazi, ordered him to leave a minimum force to hold Cyrenaica, and send the largest force he could to Greece.  The outcome proved Orwell’s worst fears to be correct.</em></p>
<p><em>[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Wavell,_1st_Earl_Wavell">General Ioannis Metaxas</a> (1871-1941), Prime Minister of Greece since 1935, had established a form of dictatorship despite being a strong supporter of the monarchy.  He successfully organised the defence when Italy invaded in 1940, but declined the offer of British tank and artillery units, foreseeing that Churchill could offer only limited aid, which could provoke a German invasion.  A British Expeditionary Force landed at Piraeus on 7 March, the Germans invaded on 6 April, and had conquered Greece by 28 April.</em></p>
<p><em>[3] At the beginning of the war, the RAF was required to drop leaflets over Germany, instead of bombs, in a vain hope of persuading the German people of the folly of their leaders’ ways.  It was not an action that commended itself to the ordinary man-in-the-street at the time.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall:_A_Channel_Story">Nevil Shute’s popular novel </a></em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall:_A_Channel_Story">Landfall</a> <em>[<a href="http://www.nevilshute.org/Reviews/landfall3.php">which Orwell reviewed</a>] gave a fair indication of the response to this policy: Pilots flying such a mission in January 1940 ‘were amused and scornful of the job they had to do.  “Hitler doesn’t give a . . . for the stuff,” was the general opinion. . . .  They expressed the view that the Fuhrer welcomed the paper for sanitary reasons’ (chapter V).</em></p>
<p><em>[4] <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sebastian-haffner-1046357.html">Sebastian Haffner</a> (1907-1999) had arrived in England from Germany in 1938.  He was not Jewish, but his wife was, and he was strongly opposed to Nazism.  Although Secker &amp; Warburg had published his ‘brilliant analysis of Nazism, </em><a href="http://www.littlebrown.co.uk/Title/9780349118895">Germany – Jekyll and Hyde</a><em> (Fyvel, 99), which came out the day Paris fell, 14 June 1940, the British authorities interned him, and it took all Warburg’s persuasive powers to have him released.  He became a correspondent on German affairs for </em>The Observer<em> and wrote for Fyvel and Orwell the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Books">Searchlight Book </a></em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight_Books">Offensive Against Germany</a><em>, to which Orwell here refers.  The book, which attempted to distinguish between ‘Germany’ and ‘Nazism,’ came out in late February or early March 1941.  Haffner returned to work in Germany in 1954.  His real name was Raimund Pretzel; the pseudonym was adopted from the title of a Mozart symphony.  See Fredric Warburg, All Authors are Equal, 6-8.</em></p>
<p><em>[5] The liberation of Eritrea and Abyssinia (as Ethiopia was then called) from the Italians was rapidly and efficiently carried out. The exiled emperor, Haile Selassie, was escorted back to Ethiopia on 20 January 1941 and re-entered is capital on 5 May accompanied by General Orde Wingate. The Duke of Aosta, Italian Viceroy of Ethiopia, surrendered on 19 May. Forces under General Wavell had, with this surrender, taken some 230,000 Italians prisoner in North and East Africa. Mopping up lasted until October; by then the British commander, General Alan Cunningham, had left to command the 8<sup>th</sup> Army. Despite Orwell’s fears, Britain recognised an independent Ethiopia on 31 January 1942.</em></p>
<p><em>[6] Rumours abound in wartime, and this sounds particularly fanciful. It may, however, refer to the use of radar (then called radiolocation in Britain), which the RAF announced on 17 June as having been instrumental in defeating the Luftwaffe, and possibly to IFF – the Identification Friend or Foe system – a revised form of which had been installed in all Fighter Command’s planes after the fall of France. This might suggest an ‘electronic net’ (information from RAF Museum). </em>Peter Davison</p>
